# IDES-Data-Preparation-Java
The [International Data Exchange Service (IDES)](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/international-data-exchange-service) is a secure managed file transfer service that allows financial institutions and foreign tax authorities to securely send information on financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers in accordance with the [Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-fatca). 

IDES only accepts encrypted electronic submissions through a data preparation process. The following sample is one of many possible implementations of the data preparation process created for Java.
